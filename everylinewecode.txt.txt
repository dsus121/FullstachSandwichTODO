# Every Line WE Code
lyrics by D. Cheairs
Inspired by SofDev 2025.03 Cohort
(set to Every Breath You Take by The Police)

every line we code
when we Express and Node
two times in Strict Mode
brains overflow 
we've been watching you 

every git commit
every merged conflict
every ’/’ route hit
all that bad typescript
we've been watching you

every console.log
all the mental fog 
through flexbox frogs 
awkward dialogue
we've been watching you 

CHORUS {
every function call
each npm install 
my code base breaks 
with every validate }

every parenthesis 
every bracket and .this 
algorithmists
will the state persist?
we've been watching you 

every hook you tried
every prop supplied
every time we cried for Bob 55
we've been watching you 

the sandwich correlates
eyes backward translocate 
it's been really hard
but it's been quite fun
now we graduate

did you use Tailwind? 
did you use Zustand? 
did you use Bootstrap? 
is there more coffee?
